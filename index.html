      <h1><b>past</b></h1>
      <p>At the age of 7, Itachi had graduated from the top of his class in nin-academy of Konohagakure. At 8, he
        mastered his Sharingan eye and, at ten, became a chunnin He became the leader of his own Anbu squad at
        13.Because of these accomplishments, the Uchiha Clan (especially his father)believed that he was the future of
        the prestigious family. This made Fugaku focus most of his attention on Itachi, and not on
        his brother, Sasuke, who was
        mostly neglected Every time Sasuke would ask
        Itachi to show him some new type of jutsu or a new ability, or just to
        help him practice with his kunai throwing skill (in which he was very lacking), he never had time,
        and always responded to him, promising that he would definitely spend time with him later by poking him in the
        forehead
        with his index and middle fingers. Itachi began
        saying that he would train with Sasuke, but he was forced by his missions to break
        his promise. This too was another reason that his younger brother Sasuke hated him as
        they grew up. No, not hated, but rather envied. Their father gave him more attention than a teenager like him
        really needed.
        He paid no attention to Sasuke as he grew and became better, seeing that he was nowhere near as much of a
        prodigy as Itachi was. Itachi did, however, attempt to treat him like a human being. He wanted his eyes to grow
        up strong, he must have thought. He did, however, make his father spend more time with Sasuke by refusing to do
        missions unless his father went along.

      <h1><b><big>he becomes anbu</big></b></h1>
      <p>Six months after he became an Anbu squad leader, Itachi began losing ground with the clan. He began to neglect
        his missions, and was a prime suspect in his best friend, Shisui Uchiha's death (Shisui had apparently committed
        suicide, but it was questioned by the clan elders). When a band of investigators confronted him, he easily
        defeated them, saying that he had lost faith in the clan. He later apologized at his father's bidding. Itachi's
        father then began spending more time with Sasuke, trying to steer him away from Itachi's path. In recent flash
        backs it is revealed that at first, Itachi had a lot of motivation to play with his younger brother, but his
        mother often forced him to do his homework or some other chore, as if she were trying to keep him from having
        any form of fun with his younger brother. But, Itachi would tell her that he could always complete his homework
        later as the assignment was simple. Sasuke had memories of his brother playing hide and seek with him, and
        finding him, then just using a Shadow Clone (Kage Bunshin) technique to confuse him even more. When the day was
        over, he would simply poke him in the forehead and tell him that he could continue this "next time" and would
        then go home.</p>

      <h1><b><big>itachi return</big></b></h1>
      <p>Itachi's first appearance in the series was placed right after the Chūnin Exams and the Third Hokage's death
        arc, in Konoha. Itachi and hispartner, Kisame Hoshigake, who first appeared cloaked and with giant brimmed hats,
        were unnoticeable by the normal public masses as they went along through the village. Their goal to capture
        Naruto uzumaki and extract the Nine-Tailed fox spirit inside of him. Asuma Sarutobi and Kurenai Yuhi first
        sensed the two at a tea shop in Konoha, and then they quickly dragged them off to an area far away from public
        view, to face their opponents. They commented on how Itachi and his partner were both S-Ranked bingo book
        criminals, and extremely dangerous, more so than that, had been exiled from Konoha for his crimes.Itachi
        unmasked himself, and his partner did also, and told them to step aside, as he did not want to kill them. Asuma
        made a comment on how that was a strange thing for someone who'd committed parricide to say, and Itachi was
        taken on by Kurenai right after. Asuma and Kisame began to battle also, neither a clear victor, with Asuma using
        his wind chakra to slice across Kisame's face without it being a visible blade. As he did this, Kurenai
        disappeared, and Itachi quickly discerned that this technique was genjutsu. Tree roots began to wrap around him,
        and he looked up as the upper half of Kurenai's body formed above him, and sliced down.Itachi looked up and with
        a sly smile, reversed it with ease.</p>
